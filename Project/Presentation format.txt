Slide - II
Introductory & Motivation
Where is Towbar used ?
Every Aircraft has specified Towbar,
Design dynamics in next slide

Slide - III
Regulations Involved: FAA (Length)
Original Material: AISI 4130 Steel

Product Design(in Reference): Commercial Passenger Aircraft
Weight(Maximum Take-Off Weight): 102 Tons

(A320 Picture)

Slide IV
Design Regulations by FAA: 
- Minimum Length & Maximum Length of Towbar Specified
- FOS (TowBar Operations): 1.5 - 1.95 

Slide V
Load Profile
Reference: A3 , US Army Engineering**

Majority Forces Applied (Experimental Results of Physical Testing):
- Axial Loads (Majorly)
- Bending Load (Friction between Lunette and pintle)
- Torsional Load* (Zero to Minimalistic) 
(Due to Universal Joint Connections at ends)
(To allow adequate degree of freedom with regard to rotation)
(Swaying forces have been neglected due to low-speed operations)

Slide - VII: Design Requirements:
- Strength Requirements (Priority):
- Stiffness Requirements:
- Low NVH Profile: 

Slide - VI: 
Problem Formulation
- Function: TowBar System for Aviation Ground Operations

- Constraints:
- Length Specified - Minimum Length and Maximum Length Specified as per AAA
- Must have adequate strength to function under compressive 
load environment and withstand critical buckling load
- Must have adequate stiffness to work through the lateral
loads during the transportation
- Ability to Damp the vibrations and limit the axis-symmetric 
excitations/longitudnal excitations in the line of pushback operations
- Have adequate Fracture Toughnessto work through the operational
environment
- Corrosion Resisstant
- Tunette and Pintle Dimensions are fixed
- Area distribution such that it resists - Column Buckling and Shell Buckling

Slide VII
- Objective: 
- - Minimize Mass
- - Minimize Cost

Free Variables:
- Section Area 
- Choice of Material

Slide VIII:
Selection Process - Bounding Box Calculations

Assumptions:
Modelled as Column 
Low Speed Operations: Swaying considerations over a straight path is neglected , As permissive swaying is requirement
