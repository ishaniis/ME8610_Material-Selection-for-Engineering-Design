Regulating Body: FAA
Original Material: AISI 4130 Steel

Objective: To Minimize Mass and Cost of Tow bar system for Aviation Operations

Tow-Bar design for A320 Commercial Passenger Aircraft
- Weight (Maximum Take-Off Weight): 93,000Kg (102 Tons)

FOS Specified for Towbar Application (1.5 - 1.95) 
Taking Extreme FOS
(Might lead to over-designing , 
could be obstacle in lightweighting 
applications)

Extreme FOS Compensates for all the maximum dynamic operational loads
in a given application.

Majority Forces applied (Experimental Data):
- Axial Loads (Majorly)
- Bending Load (Friction between Lunette and pintle)
- Torsional Load* (Zero to Minimalistic) 
(Due to Universal Joint Connections at ends)
(To allow adequate degree of freedom with regard to rotation)
(Swaying forces have been neglected due to low-speed operations)

Effects of reducing mass and Cost
- Cost Reduction would help reduce the operation costs, as
it comprises of nearly 3.6% aviations ground operations costs.
(As you need different towbars for different aircrafts as 
per their towbar specified length by the regulating authority)
- Minimize Mass 

Requirements:
- Strength Requirements
- Stiffness Requirements
- Low NVH Profile (As it even affects the structural indemnity of the Aircraft too a certain extent)

Function: Towbar System for Aviation Operations
(Pushback Truck Mechanical Linkage between NLG and Pushback)

Constraints - 
- Length Specified - Minimum Length and Maximum Length Specified as per AAA
- Must have adequate strength to function under compressive 
load environment and withstand critical buckling load
- Must have adequate stiffness to work through the lateral
loads during the transportation
- Ability to Damp the vibrations and limit the axis-symmetric 
excitations/longitudnal excitations in the line of pushback operations
- Have adequate Fracture Toughnessto work through the operational
environment
- Corrosion Resisstant
- Tunette and Pintle Dimensions are fixed

Objective:
- Minimize Mass
- Minimize Cost

Free Variable:
- Section Area 
- Choice of Material

Replace Ro by Cm * Ro
